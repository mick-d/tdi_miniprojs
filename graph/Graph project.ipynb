    "annotated captions labeling those that appear in the photos.  We can think of\n",
    "this as implicitly implying a social graph: there is a connection between two\n",
    "individuals if they appear in a picture together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetching the data can be broken down into two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to crawl the data.  We want photos from parties before\n",
    "December 1st, 2014.  Go to `http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/party-pictures`\n",
    "to see a list of (party) pages.  For each party's page, grab all the captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints\n",
    "  1. Click on the on the index page and see how they change the url.  Use this\n",
    "     to determine a strategy to get all the data.\n",
    "  2. Notice that each party has a date on the index page.  Use python's\n",
    "     `datetime.strptime` function to parse it.\n",
    "  3. Some captions are not useful: they contain long narrative texts that\n",
    "     explain the event.  Usually in two stage processes like this, it is better\n",
    "     to keep more data in the first stage and then filter it out in the second\n",
    "     stage.  This makes your work more reproducible.  It's usually faster to\n",
    "     download more data than you need now than to have to redownload more data\n",
    "     later.\n",
    "  4. To avoid having to re-scrape every time you run your code, you can\n",
    "\t consider saving the data to disk, and having the parsing code load a file.\n",
    "\t A checkpoint library like\n",
    "\t [ediblepickle](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ediblepickle/1.1.3) can\n",
    "     streamline the process so that the time-consuming code will only be run\n",
    "     when necessary.\n",
    "  5. HTTP requests can sometimes fail inconsistently. You should expect to\n",
    "     run into this issue and deal with it as best you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a list of all captions, you should probably save the data on\n",
    "disk so that you can quickly retrieve it.  Now comes the parsing part.\n",
    "  1. Some captions are not useful: they contain long narrative texts that\n",
    "     explain the event.  Try to find some heuristic rules to separate captions\n",
    "     that are a list of names from those that are not.  A few heuristics\n",
    "     include:\n",
    "      - look for sentences (which have verbs) and as opposed to lists of nouns.\n",
    "        For example, [nltk does part of speech\n",
    "        tagging](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html) but it is a little slow.\n",
    "        There may also be heuristics that accomplish the same thing.\n",
    "      - Look for commonly repeated threads (e.g. you might end up picking up\n",
    "        the photo credits or people such as \"a friend\").\n",
    "      - Long captions are often not lists of people.  The cutoff is subjective,\n",
    "        but for grading purposes, *set that cutoff at 250 characters*.\n",
    "  2. You will want to separate the captions based on various forms of\n",
    "     punctuation.  Try using `re.split`, which is more sophisticated than\n",
    "     `string.split`.\n",
    "  3. You might find a person named \"ra Lebenthal\".  There is no one by this\n",
    "     name.  Can anyone spot what's happening here?\n",
    "  4. This site is pretty formal and likes to say things like \"Mayor Michael\n",
    "     Bloomberg\" after his election but \"Michael Bloomberg\" before his election.\n",
    "     Can you find other ('optional') titles that are being used?  They should\n",
    "     probably be filtered out b/c they ultimately refer to the same person:\n",
    "     \"Michael Bloomberg.\"\n",
    "  4. There is a special case you might find where couples are written as eg.\n",
    "     \"John and Mary Smith\". You will need to write some extra logic to make\n",
    "     sure this properly parses to two names: \"John Smith\" and \"Mary Smith\".\n",
    "  5. When parsing names from captions, it can help to look at your output\n",
    "     frequently and address the problems that you see coming up, iterating\n",
    "     until you have a list that looks reasonable. This is the approach used\n",
    "     in the reference solution. Because we can only asymptotically approach\n",
    "     perfect identification and entity matching, we have to stop somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further considerations (not included in solution)**\n",
    "  1. Who is Patrick McMullan and should he be included in the results? How would\n",
    "     you address this?\n",
    "  2. What else could you do to improve the quality of the graph's information?\n",
