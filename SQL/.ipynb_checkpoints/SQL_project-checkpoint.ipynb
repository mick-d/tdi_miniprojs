    "1. It is recommended to use sqlite3 for this project. Postgresql can work but\n",
    "   will be more difficult to set up properly on Digital Ocean. If you do use\n",
    "   sqlite, in order to do mathematical calculations like square root, you will\n",
    "   need to compile and install the extension described on the\n",
    "   [wiki](https://sites.google.com/a/thedataincubator.com/the-data-incubator-wiki/course-information-and-logistics/getting-started/setup).\n",
    "2. Sqlite3 has a convenient .import function which can create tables from .csv .\n",
    "   You may want to set up your databases using the sqlite shell, then use Python\n",
    "   just to run the SELECT queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Postgresql has an equivalent [`\\copy`\n",
    "   command](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY)\n",
    "   that can both save and load files in various formats.  It is a convenience\n",
    "   wrapper for the [`copy`\n",
    "   command](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-copy.html) but\n",
    "   behaves better (e.g. relative paths).\n",
    "3. The files may contain malformatted text.  Unfortunately, this is all too\n",
    "   common.  As a stop gap, remember that `iconv` is a unix utility that can\n",
    "   convert files between different text encodings.\n",
    "4. For more sophisticated needs, a good strategy is to write simple python\n",
    "   scripts that will reparse files.  For example, commas (',') within a single\n",
    "   field will trick many csv parsers into breaking up the field.  Write a\n",
